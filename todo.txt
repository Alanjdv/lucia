Things still needed:
* A translation system.
*proper distance handling with rolloff and silence after a certain distance, should be no more than 70.
*a documentation of the toolset available and how it may be used, with some examples.
*higher level wrapper around speech where you can just call speech.speak/.stop/whatever and it will do whatever you like, include an auto detection mode and in this autodetection function you should specify if you want screen reader detection to be included. This will make game voice output much easier to work with, while still allowing self-voicing games. Kinda how the menu does it.

Bugs:
* Correct loading of resources on mac when the application is bondled.
Path to resources folder in application folder:
name.app/Contents/Resources/
